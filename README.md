# Quizapp

This is my first Flutter Application.

I've created a quiz app which will have multiple choice questions and after completing the quiz, total score will be displayed for the correct answers.

## How to get started?
- Download [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). Select the operating system of your device and install the SDK.
- Set up Path for macOS :
  1. view hidden files using cmd+shift+. 
  2. open .bash_profile if you are using bash in Terminal or .zshrc if using zsh. 
  3. Type the below command 

         export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/bin"
  4. Save the file, Refresh the terminal and type below command to check if flutter is working or not
  
         flutter doctor
- Create your first application using the below command

      flutter create name_of_project
                              
## Dart files

You can find it in the [lib](https://github.com/anjali-patel21/QuizApp-Flutter/tree/main/lib) folder which includes all the .dart files. 

## APK

You can download the [APK file](https://github.com/anjali-patel21/QuizApp-Flutter/blob/main/app-release.apk) and run the application in your android device.
